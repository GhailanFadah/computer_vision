🔧 Prerequisites

C++ Compiler with C++11 support or later (g++, clang++)
OpenCV 4.x or later
CMake 3.10+ (if using CMake build system)
ONNX Runtime (for depth estimation model)
Pre-trained depth estimation model: model_fp16.onnx

System Requirements

Webcam (for live video mode)
Minimum 4GB RAM
Modern CPU with SSE2 support

📦 Installation
1. Install OpenCV
Ubuntu/Debian
bashsudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
macOS
bashbrew install opencv
Windows
Download pre-built binaries from OpenCV releases
2. Clone the Repository
bashgit clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
3. Compile the Project
bashg++ -o vidDisplay vidDisplay.cpp filters.cpp faceDetect.cpp DA2Network.cpp \
    `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`
Or using CMake:
bashmkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
4. Download Model File
Place the model_fp16.onnx depth estimation model in the project directory.
🚀 Usage
Mode 1: Live Video Stream
bash./vidDisplay 1
Mode 2: Static Image
bash./vidDisplay 2 <path-to-image>
Example:
bash./vidDisplay 2 sample_image.jpg
```

## ⌨️ Filter Controls

Press the following keys while the application is running to apply different filters:

| Key | Filter/Effect | Description |
|-----|---------------|-------------|
| `g` | OpenCV Grayscale | Built-in grayscale conversion |
| `h` | Custom Grayscale | Custom implementation of grayscale |
| `p` | Sepia Tone | Vintage photograph effect |
| `b` | Blur | 5x5 Gaussian blur |
| `x` | Sobel X | Horizontal edge detection |
| `y` | Sobel Y | Vertical edge detection |
| `m` | Magnitude | Combined edge magnitude |
| `l` | Blur Quantize | Color reduction with blur (10 levels) |
| `f` | Face Detection | Detect and draw boxes around faces |
| `d` | Depth Blur | Depth estimation with bokeh effect |
| `e` | Emboss | 3D embossed appearance |
| `n` | Negative | Inverted colors |
| `3` | Face Negative | Negative filter only on detected faces |
| `c` | Cartoon | Cartoon/comic book effect |
| `z` | Edge Glow | Glowing edge effect |
| `s` | Save Frame | Save current filtered frame as `frame.png` |
| `q` | Quit | Exit application |

### Tips
- Press the filter key once to activate it
- Press `s` to save the current view
- Press `q` to quit the application
- Original video displays when no filter is active

🔬 Technical Details
Image Processing Techniques

Sobel Operators: 3x3 convolution kernels for edge detection
Gaussian Blur: 5x5 kernel for noise reduction
Face Detection: Haar Cascade or DNN-based detection
Depth Estimation: Deep learning model (ONNX format)

Performance

Real-time processing at camera frame rate (typically 30 FPS)
Depth estimation runs at reduced resolution (0.5x scale factor)
Face detection with temporal smoothing for stability

Dependencies
cpp#include "opencv2/opencv.hpp"  // Core OpenCV functionality
#include "filters.h"            // Custom filter implementations
#include "faceDetect.h"         // Face detection utilities
#include "DA2Network.hpp"       // Depth estimation network
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Camera not opening:**
```
Unable to open video device

Ensure webcam is connected and not in use by another application
Try changing camera index in cv::VideoCapture(0) to (1) or (2)

Model file not found:

Verify model_fp16.onnx is in the same directory as the executable
Check file permissions

Compilation errors:

Ensure OpenCV is properly installed: pkg-config --modversion opencv4
Verify all source files are present
Check C++ standard: -std=c++11 or later

Slow performance:

Depth estimation (d filter) is computationally intensive
Try reducing video resolution or using a faster machine
